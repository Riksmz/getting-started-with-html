<h2>So, how does the internet work, generally?</h2>
<p>The internet is connected through various hosting servers that allow users to <em>link
up </em>with each other, and incredibly, share information. This <em>information</em> usually comes in the form of <em>web pages</em>, which we access through web browsers. There doesn't seem to be a limit to the amount and type of information that can
  be shared amongst its users, so long as you have the know-how and proper resources.

</p>
<h2>What exactly is <em>HTML</em>?</h2>
<p>HTML is <b>exactly</b> <em>hypertext markup language</em>. HTML is the text content of the web page, and the links and references to other documents contained therein. Basically, its everything you'd see when you open the web page.
</p>
<h2>Tags and elements:</h2>
<p>Elements are the building blocks of the HTML language that are used to display the information on the web page. Now, in order to tell our computer which elements to use an how to use them, we need tags. <em>Tags</em> are essentially our instructions to
  the program.
</p>
<p>
  Amongst these <em>tags</em>, we have some that are <em>inline</em> elements and some that are <em>block</em> elements.
  <em>Inline</em> elemnts can be inserted into lines of content without causing a break, whereas <em>block</em> elements will actually create a sort of "invisible box" around the content, which may even seperate it to itself.
